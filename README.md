Crafting Interpreters: compilers/interpreters for the Lox language

Following along with https://craftinginterpreters.com/ book.

We're implementing the first interpreter in C#, the second TBD.

The "s" in slox stands for Scott (:wave:).

## extensions/customizations
* REPL:
    * commands (`:token`, `:parse`, `:quit`, etc.)
    * multiline support (end line with `\`)
